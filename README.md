### Singleton Design Pattern

The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. It is useful when you want to control the access to a resource or when a single instance is needed across the entire application.

### Applying Singleton to `KafkaServiceManager`

In your code, `KafkaServiceManager` is designed as a Singleton to manage Kafka producers and consumers. Here’s how it fits into the Singleton pattern:

1. **Private Constructor**: The constructor `KafkaServiceManager::KafkaServiceManager()` is private, preventing direct instantiation of `KafkaServiceManager` objects from outside the class.

2. **Static Instance**: The static method `KafkaServiceManager& KafkaServiceManager::getInstance()` provides the single point of access to the unique instance of `KafkaServiceManager`. It ensures that only one instance of `KafkaServiceManager` is created and shared across the application.

3. **Lazy Initialization**: The instance of `KafkaServiceManager` (`obj`) is initialized the first time `getInstance()` is called, using a static local variable. This ensures that the instance is created only when it is first needed.

### Example Usage

Here’s how you can use `KafkaServiceManager` in your application:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "kafkamanager.h"

int main() {
    // Initialize Kafka producer and consumer
    KafkaServiceManager::getInstance().producer_init("server_name", "broker_hostAndPort");
    KafkaServiceManager::getInstance().consumer_init("server_name", "broker_hostAndPort", "group_name", "group_id");

    // Produce a message
    KafkaServiceManager::getInstance().produce("topic_name", "Hello Kafka!", strlen("Hello Kafka!"));

    // Consume messages from a topic
    KafkaServiceManager::getInstance().consume("topic_name");

    // Destroy resources (automatically done by Singleton destructor)
    // No need to manually destroy or cleanup KafkaServiceManager

    return 0;
}
```

### Documentation for `KafkaServiceManager`

#### Class: `KafkaServiceManager`

##### Purpose
The `KafkaServiceManager` class manages Kafka producers and consumers as a Singleton instance, ensuring that only one instance exists and is globally accessible throughout the application.

##### Public Methods

- `static KafkaServiceManager& getInstance()`
  - Returns the Singleton instance of `KafkaServiceManager`.
  
- `void producer_init(std::string server_name, std::string broker_hostAndPort)`
  - Initializes a Kafka producer with the specified server and broker information.
  
- `void produce(std::string topic, std::string message, int len)`
  - Sends a message to the specified Kafka topic using the initialized producer.
  
- `void consumer_init(std::string server_name, std::string broker_hostAndPort, std::string group_name, std::string group_id)`
  - Initializes a Kafka consumer with the specified server, broker, consumer group name, and group ID.
  
- `void consume(std::string topic)`
  - Starts consuming messages from the specified Kafka topic using the initialized consumer.

##### Private Members

- `rd_kafka_t *prod_rk`
  - Pointer to the Kafka producer instance (`rd_kafka_t`).

- `rd_kafka_conf_t *prod_conf`
  - Pointer to the Kafka producer configuration (`rd_kafka_conf_t`).

- `rd_kafka_t *cons_rk`
  - Pointer to the Kafka consumer instance (`rd_kafka_t`).

- `rd_kafka_conf_t *cons_conf`
  - Pointer to the Kafka consumer configuration (`rd_kafka_conf_t`).

- `rd_kafka_topic_partition_list_t *topics`
  - Pointer to the list of Kafka topics for consumer subscription (`rd_kafka_topic_partition_list_t`).

##### Usage Example
```cpp
// Initialize and use KafkaServiceManager
KafkaServiceManager::getInstance().producer_init("localhost", "9092");
KafkaServiceManager::getInstance().produce("test_topic", "Hello Kafka!", strlen("Hello Kafka!"));
KafkaServiceManager::getInstance().consumer_init("localhost", "9092", "test_group", "group_id");
KafkaServiceManager::getInstance().consume("test_topic");
```

##### Notes

- Ensure proper initialization and error handling in production code.
- The Singleton pattern simplifies resource management and access to Kafka functionality across the application.

This documentation outlines how `KafkaServiceManager` implements the Singleton pattern to manage Kafka producers and consumers effectively. Adjust the details and examples as per your specific project requirements and coding standards.
